# Sabotage-js13kgames
This is my entry for js13kgames: http://js13kgames.com/

About project: 
Sabotage is top-down game based on tilemaps. Main goal of each level is to access the antenna and hack it - then entire campus goes offline
and sabotage is done.
Main mechanics is to stay quiet and not detected by enemies patrolling campus.
Moving: WSAD.
Player can kill enemy by knife using L key but just when enemy can't see player - for example when player attacks from behind. Range of knife is 1 tile in 4 directions.
But be careful, killed enemy spreads blood which can be saw by other enemy! 
Do not let this happen and clean floor using P key.

Attached source is readable in about 70%, because when I reached 11kb of 13kb limit I stopped writing descriptive variable names and I operated on one-two chars names.
Today I extended names of the most important variables using VS Code and also there are comments available to get what's going on.
